# WorkoutCyclingSaver

This app developed on Kotlin language is my final project of the DAM degree. The function of this program is to store the data of the cycling training sessions that we collect through a basic cycle computer, such as the maximum and average pulsations, accumulated unevenness, etc...
With the different data collected, statistics are generated in which we can visualize our progressions on the bike.
This is an Alpha version, so it isnÂ´t without bugs.
